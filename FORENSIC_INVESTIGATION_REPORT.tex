\subsection{Evidence Significance}

\subsubsection{Immortality Folder}
The folder name ``Immortality'' directly corresponds to the patent project mentioned in Charlie's extortion email to andy@swexpert.com, where he states: \textit{``I found a prior patent that will definitely invalidate your current immortality patent.''}

\subsubsection{Thumbs.db File}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Type:} Windows Thumbnail Cache (Composite Document File V2)
    \item \textbf{Significance:} Proves that the TIF files were viewed/accessed on a Windows system
    \item \textbf{Contains:} Cached thumbnails of us005026637-001.tif and us006982168-001.tif
    \item \textbf{Forensic Value:} Demonstrates deliberate file access and viewing activity
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Patent Documents (TIF Files)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{us005026637-001.tif} -- US Patent document (prior art evidence)
    \item \textbf{us006982168-001.tif} -- US Patent document (prior art evidence)
    \item \textbf{Significance:} These are the proprietary patent research documents that Charlie exfiltrated from M57.biz and used for extortion purposes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Password Recovery}

The password for the ZIP archive was recovered from email evidence:

\begin{quotebox}
\textbf{From:} Charlie\_2009-12-04\_1306\_Sent.txt \\
\textit{``Got the deposit. The password to get the info is \textbf{nitro}. Use the steg program we talked about. And don't forget to delete these emails.''}
\end{quotebox}

``Andy,

Lucky for me, I just happened to stumble across this. I found a prior patent that will definitely invalidate your current immortality patent. You should have used my boss's prior art services, but, oh well, I'll just use your negligence to benefit me. \textbf{I want 100k or I'll release this publicly.} I don't need to tell you how much this will hurt your business if I go public with this. \textbf{Don't involve the cops} or this information will go public. See the attachment for details on what I found. I'll be in touch with my bank acct number. The password for the zip file will be hidden in the next picture I send you.
